Topic : Function in Python
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
It helps make your program organized, readable, and reusable.
Built-in Functions → Already provided by Python
Examples: print(), len(), max(), sum()

User-defined Functions → Created by the programmer
Example: def greet(): print("Hello")
